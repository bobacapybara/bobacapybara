Passionate about the intersection of business and data analytics, I earned a Masterâ€™s degree in Supply Chain Management in 2019. Today, I leverage both academic knowledge and hands-on experience to translate complex data into actionable strategies that streamline operations, optimize costs, and drive business growth.
